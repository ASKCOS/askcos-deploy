This directory contains a webhook listener script to trigger continuous deployment of the askcos-demo site.

The listener script is derived from https://github.com/pstauffer/gitlab-webhook-receiver with modifications.

To start the listener, run the following:

python gitlab-webhook-receiver.py --addr <ip address to listen> --port <port to listen> &> listener.log
